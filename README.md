# canvas-ui
This is a HTML5 canvas UI test. It simply renders page objects from an array, `pageObjects`, which contains objects with the following structure:

    {
        x: x-location,
        y: y-location,
        width: width,
        height: height,
        text: "Object text",
        click: function() {
            // click actions
        }
    }

This is just an experiment, and is quite impractical. Mess with it if you want. Improve it.
